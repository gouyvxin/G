# Use Abaqus to simulate the electric spark bubbles in a circular tube. Since the file is too large, it is split into twenty small files. After downloading all of them, change the file name to .inp and import the model in version 2024 or higher. The mesh, boundary conditions and parameters of each material are all in the model.
